Today I found out 3 trivial things

1. People like free stuff, it's hard to convince people to spend money
2. Companies don't need vitamin products but painkillers.
3. There are always competitors with more resources who will solve the problem better than you.

So what is the solution to this?

I think one solution is finding a niche, so small that your competitors will not dive into that space. Don't create big products but do it in really small chunks, if possible don't write code but validate the ideas fast. Do even more customer interviews to find pain worth digging into.

This is an ongoing journey, I'm ready to listen and learn.
