We see unnecessary bureaucracy everywhere, how can we recognize it?

- Is paper needed just for the sake of having the paper, because 100 years ago someone decided to have that?
- Is the current process just a wrapped version of the process described above with fewer steps but still with a lot of complications?
- Do people enforcing the process understand the importance of each step? 

These are all the signs of unnecessary bureaucracy.

## Why do we need bureaucracy anyway?
To make sure people are following steps that are necessary to ensure safe and trustworthy decisions/documents/laws etc...

# The human brain/memories are fragile, we can't trust it, so we decided to trust ink on trees and electrons flowing through different materials.

### How to understand that the bureaucracy needed is not present?
- Steps need to be followed for the process to be complete.
- There is no trust(unknown trust) between parties negotiating/deciding(in present, past or future).

## And if it doesn't serve its point, it's time to rethink and refactor.
