When you want to make a change you need to be clear about it with everyone involved.

Sometimes it's not "fun" or "exciting". But it's an iterative process and it should be inclusive. If people are involved, they will have ownership of the change, but it's not a fake involvement. 


Change is not about the right answer, not about "easy", not about what we like. It's hard but necessary.

# And we better enjoy the process along the way. 🎆
