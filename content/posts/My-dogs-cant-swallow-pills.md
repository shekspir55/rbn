My dog has a problem with food, it isn't motivated by it. What is worse, it's very hard for him to swallow pills, the dog hates if one puts anything into its mouth.

I found a solution. Crushing the drug to powder put it into a syringe with water, then squeeze between the dog's teeth, so I don't force the dog to open its mouth.

I saw so many veterinarians trying to force the dog to swallow, but it mostly doesn't work.

What it does is making dogs anxious.
