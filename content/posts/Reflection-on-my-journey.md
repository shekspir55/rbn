You can recover your journey from the history of my blog posts if you have been following, though you also probably know that I don't need people to read and like my posts.

About one year ago, I quit my job. It was a good decision. I started my consultancy journey and have tried several things, had clients, and helped people. 

Today I can tell that I have progress, it's not that I'm rich or something like that. But I can tell you, I love talking with people, I love consulting.

This is a boutique business. I don't plan to make it a big one, I plan to keep it small, to create culture, to create impact. I know this business is not a very good one, it will not make me rich. But will help me reach 2 goals.

1. understand how sales work, and not a used car salesman style, but how to assess people's needs and offer solutions
2. help people with my expertise

I have attended 2 conferences, networked with many people, recorded 7 podcasts, created 40 shorts, and had over ~7k views on YouTube, and 888 followers on LinkedIn. 

My videos are not the best quality, but it's better "to do good" than "not to do best" (Narek Hayrapetyan from meeting him today).

Please start doing what you want to do, it's super hard, but maybe there will be a success. If you don't try you will not succeed for sure.
