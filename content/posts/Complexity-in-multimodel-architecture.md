I can move from cities and even to countries with a single backpack and or a single hanger with a couple of clothes, be able to attend the event, and see people. 

When you have a kid, now you have a dependency, not one but probably 2, I have another dependency a dog, so you move all your clothes and stuff and also them with you.

Now imagine every "person" has a way of interacting with another person, for example, for my dog, I need to take a brush to clean its further.

So now adding one more "model" to the system doesn't make complexity n+1 but makes it n times more complex.

P.S. I moved today to Yerevan for a couple of days, and it becomes extremely challenging to do so when other dependencies are also in place.

P.P.S. When I do all the quests to move from Stepanavan to Yerevan and vice versa.
