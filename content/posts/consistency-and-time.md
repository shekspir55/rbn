Do I have time to blog?

Every time I wrote I will blog every day, I've reflected on this commitment in several posts:

- In [I Need to Revisit My Blogs](/posts/i-need-to-revisit-my-blogs), I discussed how I try to write every day and how blog posts are learnings from my observations.
- In [Everything Has a Purpose](/posts/everything-has-a-purpose), I shared my motivation for blogging and the importance of not skipping days.
- In [Are You Consistent?](/posts/are-you-consistent), I reflected on the challenges of maintaining daily blogging when tired or busy.
- In [How Much for an Ad in Your Blog?](/posts/how-much-for-an-ad-in-your-blog), I mentioned how I've been writing daily for about 3 months and noticed improvements in my analytical skills.
- In [Hello world Again](/posts/hello-world-again), I acknowledged the importance of daily blogging for my thought process and analysis.

I failed, so now what?

Now I continue.

This is another attempt, now we need to make it stick, no excuses. 2 sentences a day is enough. Putting blank dot on a canvas is a start.

I just need to make my tools more accessible, so I don't skip. And if I skip, just contniue writing.
