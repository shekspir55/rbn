Today I was reading "Puss in Boots" for my 1-year-old.

Upon finishing my thought, what was the premise of this story?

1. PR is really important, and probably people and companies need to have good PR managers.
2. Learned helplessness is promoted
3. You will need a good sponsor in life to succeed

The latter two are controversial.

Fortunately, there are a lot of better stories now.

I think we need to question what was passed to us from generations, what context it has in the past, and what context it may have now.
