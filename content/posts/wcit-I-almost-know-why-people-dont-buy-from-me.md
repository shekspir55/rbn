In the first part of the event, I asked people what they do and what challenges they have, but it's kind of hard. People are not ready to expose themselves yet.

In the second half, Martha came. We were discussing, what should we do?

We were asking people what are we doing wrong, and why should your company not buy from us! The answers were deep. I will continue doing it tomorrow, let's see where it takes us, and what insights we'll get!

One of the wonderful feedbacks was "The person buying from you should understand that they have screwed up or people they hired screwed up, and I don't see how that will happen", I agree, this was powerful feedback. 


The website changes: First I will add photos of my consultants to the website. I have also added a challenge there. I like how the website can be an interactive communication tool.
