I have talked to people, exposed myself, and told them what I wanted to do.

Today, I did a podcastâ€”not the open-source one, but one about TDD for the consultancy. I think it's an underappreciated topic. 

I think I'm on the correct path, these iterations bring value, and I get to know people, what they feel, and what they breathe.

This is indeed hard work, one that will be rewarded one day, we'll see. I will let you know on the progress.
