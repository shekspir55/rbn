I have been hiring for 4 years now, and it's time for me to get hired.

My approach was simple, if a person was a cultural fit and was motivated, could solve problems, they got hired.  I didn't ask people to solve problems they won't solve at work, just the necessary things. I gave second chances, gave feedback, and did a lot of interviews.

Recently I applied to a couple of places, and here is what I discovered.
1. Though forms are everywhere they don't feel valued in the forms, I hate forms, and I love email. Email makes the whole process of applying for a job so much more personalized, you have a chance to be you.
2. A lot of times companies answer with no-reply email, and that feels like a close club, where you cannot even ask some questions.
3. Companies talk about values but don't keep them on while hiring.
4. If a company asks you to use 1-2 or 3+ hours of your time to fill in the forms or do a test task, I think a candidate deserves some kind of feedback.

# I know that the world can't be ideal but I also know that empathy can go a long way.
