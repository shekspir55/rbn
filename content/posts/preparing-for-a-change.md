We have been discussing this yesterday. Change-making is hard, but we need to prepare people for it, there will be resistance and it's all about that, so there are at least 2 things we could do.

1. Try to understand people's fears, and try to convince them the fears are not true.
2. Try to engage people in change-making, if they will have a part, they will engage.

I knew about option 1, but what about option 2? Is it even possible?

You need to delegate the work to them, if you can convince them to help you, do that, if not, don't bother.
