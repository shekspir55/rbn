Attention is interesting, I find wonderful people replying to the post, and I'm shocked. So, the LinkedIn lecture was awesome and helpful I will try to apply the skills, and I will take the class later. I love this order.

I will try to finalize packages next week I will ask my friends for help. If you want to help me finalize the packages please write a comment. I will contact you for sure.
