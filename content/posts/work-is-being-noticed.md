If you do something good, do it publicly,  even if nobody will notice, people will notice.

There is one caveat, your work should be public. It should be open and you shouldn't be afraid of sharing it with the world.

# All you need is exposure and time, everything else will come naturally.

Of course, there is a way to accelerate it like running ads, doing SEO, and organizing events, but it all will come together once the work is good enough and when it's worth it.
