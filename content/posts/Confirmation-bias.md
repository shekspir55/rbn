# What is it?
When you jump to a conclusion and try confirm your point of view search for things that confirm your beliefs.

## Why it's important?
We are often one-sided, we try to make sure we are right. 

I find myself increasingly trying to find confirmation for my ideas, and I'm thankful when people tell me that I'm wrong, when I can hear a second perspective.

# Being wrong is normal.
