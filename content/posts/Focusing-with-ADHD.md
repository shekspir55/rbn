Recently I was consuming a lot of information. Did you notice it's hard to focus? It's hard to digest. It's almost like you have a lot of food in your mouth but cannot swallow it.

I found a way to manage my ADHD just a little bit. It's walking and removing all distractions. I go to the forest and disable my notifications. I don't pick up the phone. I just think and write.

I have found out a lot, and mostly what was interesting to me, not every day can be productive, in terms of focusing, but when I am consistent I can see patterns and results.

I discovered that going up the hill was preparation for focus and thoughts, and going down the hill was the best time to be creative.
