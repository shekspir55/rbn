Doing the hard part first.

As an engineer, I tend to jump into solving problems. And it's ok when I work on a project with clear architecture and set goals.

The question "who is it for?" finding the minimal viable audience is important.

When I think about [open-source podcasts](/posts/starting-yet-another-podcast), I tend to think "I need a website, I need a podcasting platform, I need an RSS feed so people can import it and listen".

But what I really need is to talk to people who are my audience, for whom I am doing the podcast.

To be clear, the concept for the podcast is to help people make a living with their open-source projects and to help people understand all the benefits and challenges of running an open-source business.

If you resonate with this idea, please let me know what would you like to see and hear during the podcast. Who should I interview? What should I ask them? Also please suggest some

If you don't resonate, thank you for reading.
