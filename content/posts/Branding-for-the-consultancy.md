I  had an idea about the logo and mascot for the powered-by.love consultancy.

So it is an iterative process, and I thought that it would be easy to do this project asynchronously, with the branding specialis, but I was wrong.

Today we had a jamming session, when we brainstormed and prototyped. We will have 6 logos which I like, to choose from.

# what should community do?

Now will be a challenge for the community, to brainstorm and understand which one of those 6 will be the final logo. No marketing, no people manipulation, I will try to put 2 versions, one on LinkedIn, and one in my telegram community, I probably give 2 points to the winner in telegram community to have more weight.


let's see where it goes!


# UPD
One more voting on mastodon same as linkedin!
