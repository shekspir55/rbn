Disclaimer, this is not my opinion, this was a conversation from yesterday with my friend Tigran. I am not too familiar with the topic but I love how the "customer perspective", it's a part of important discovery from the point of view of a fan of the topic.

## Tigran's words

Optimus Prime was a father figure. A father figure cannot be depicted cutting a decepticon throat. It should say "Believe in yourself." and not be violent.

It's not only a father figure but also a truck.

What do kids love? 
# Fathers and big cars, trucks. What could be better?
