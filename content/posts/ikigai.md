Opportunities come and go, but sometimes there is THAT opportunity. 

It makes my heart sing, puts me in sync with what I live for, and creates purpose in life.

## What is Ikigai?
- What you love âœ…
- What the world needs âœ…
- What are you good at âœ…
- What can be paid for âœ…

If all checkboxes are checked âœ… it means you found it.

I have 1 offer like that, but it's not final yet. Once I have I'll let you know!

Consultancy is another ikigai for me. But I need to prove that it's sustainable.
The foundation is an ikigai for me, except for getting paid part. :)

Do you have ikigai, what does it look like for you?
