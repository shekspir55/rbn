What if I interviewed with you, I asked you a bunch of questions from discrete math but was interviewing you for the cleaning person in the company?

Let's say you've passed, will you use that knowledge? Probably not. Will you be disappointed? Probably yes.

I always said that interviews in companies are like having a boss fight in a game when in reality, working there is like coloring a coloring book.

# What is the issue with this approach?

If I have certain expectations about the job, if they are not met I will be extremely unfulfilled, and I will have cognitive dissonance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance  and be discouraged by the work.

The solution is being honest, trying to give as much work context as possible, and designing the interview process to clearly reflect and address issues that are actually tackled at work.
