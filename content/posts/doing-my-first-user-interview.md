We did it, and it was awesome.

 During the interview, we discussed the topics around the product. Once again discovered how short-sighted I am.

Everyone needs to do a lot more interviews. I think the key is to be a listener and to talk to people who are passionate about their niche.

Thanks you for this generous feedback.
