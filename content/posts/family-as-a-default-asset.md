Today I spent the whole day with different members of my family.

If we consider our life as a game, the default stats we would have would be our environment and our family.

We can choose, friends, coworkers, and countries we live in, but most of the time we don't choose our base family. We can choose to work on relationships or not to work on relationships.

There is a certain amount of lack involved in our life(actually a lot of it), but "Fortune favors the bold" so we probably better do things that matter to us, and have a long-term impact on our lives and our surroundings.
