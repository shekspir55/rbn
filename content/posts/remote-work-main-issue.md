Doing interviews around remote work, we have found 2 major problems that are present among the interviewees.

1. Commuting for many is not an option. People may spend up to 4 hours on commute. It's almost 25% of our usable time. Some even don't have that option. Either relocate or don't go to work.
2. Remote work opportunities are extremely low. Even though interviewees report being more productive, sometimes they feel stuck in their current positions because of a lack of options in the field. 

However, the flexibility of remote work surpasses many benefits of onsite work.

# I hope that we will have more inclusive opportunities for people who can and want to manage themselves.
