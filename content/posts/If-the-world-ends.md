If there is no more civilization, what skills do you need?

1. Now that you have found yourself alone, you need survival skills, hunting, making fire, clothing, and finding food, how to heal yourself.

2. Later you find a tribe of people who survived and you need to fit in, you need social skills, soft skills, you need to be trustworthy, to remain in the tribe.

3. Later your tribe found a sustainable city, where all survivors gathered and created a thriving community. Now you need to understand what you can do for the community. There are many jobs, and you need to find what mostly suits you and what the best for the community.

# The world ended, and we still need to be agile based on the environment.
