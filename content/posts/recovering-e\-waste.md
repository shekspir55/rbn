Right now I'm trying to install Windows 10 on a MacBook laptop from 2014, it is not "supported" anymore, but its hardware is much better than many other newer devices sold in laptops(running Intel Celeron or similar).

The laptop I use right now to write this blog is my framework laptop, it promises support for the components that I as a user can change, I can make this laptop a server, a computer, or anything I wouldn't do there is no "support" needed.

I have a Droid 4 phone from 2012, it runs latest Linux kernel. Isn't it wonderful? Recovering old devices giving them new life as another device, a server another type of machine so they don't decay in landfills.

I believe that companies need to think where their devices will end up at the end of their life span, phones are another example of this, I would like to have as many options for reducing and reusing as possible.
