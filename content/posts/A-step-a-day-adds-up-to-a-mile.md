I had a meeting with important people. All people are important, these ones are important to me. This was my target a couple of months ago, does this mean that I'm successful now? 

How does the journey happen? It adds up, step by step. It's not final by any means. It's not even the beginning. It's just making the soil more rich so the seeds can start growing.

I know I can help people I know it's not about me, the latest podcast is really unappreciated, it's always about people in front of you and how you can help them to get from point A to B.

I know that even if I don't find the way now it's very close.
