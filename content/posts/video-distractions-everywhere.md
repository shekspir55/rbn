Distractions are everywhere. All social media wants is to grab your attention.

All algorithms do is present us with data we would like and engage, and in most cases it's VIDEO content.

In the case of youtube, it's all about video, in the case of Linked it's also about video.

I try to control my exposure to content and prevent mindless scrolling.

I use browser extensions like 
- [Remove Youtube Shorts](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-shorts/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) to stop short from appearing in my feed.
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block "dms.licdn.com" to stop linkedin showing me videos.

Of course, Chrome alternatives exist, but my point is not to show tools. 

# Big corporations and media tend to think they know what we need, but sometimes it's to get back a little more control over our lives and attention.
