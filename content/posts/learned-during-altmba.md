Today is graduation day for altMBA, and what a ride it was.
I committed to do so many things.

I've listened to the stories of so many people. From different backgrounds from different cultures. Can I summarize it in one blog post? Probably not.

But these are just a few highlighted ideas we were discussing there.

- Change is not about the right answer, and in the real world, there are no right answers so we need to accept it. 
- If you were your boss(which you are), what feedback would you give yourself? Would you still work for you?
- Who is it for and what is it for? Questions that need to be asked constantly
- People are irrational
- Narratives are functions of assets and boundaries, but not always
- Sails is not about closing a deal but opening a conversation.

Reading this might feel that I've read a book of quotes, but this is all practice, and there is so much more to altMBA. You need to experience it for yourself. 

# For everyone it's different for sure.

People and networks are another key takeaway from all of this, I'm so happy I met this wonderful people and feel that we have truly connected. 

## Thank you for being a part of my journey and thank you for your generous feedback.

Shipping my first prompt after altMBA. This one doesn't need feedback next one will do. 

# Thank you all again, you have changed my life for better!‚ô•Ô∏è
