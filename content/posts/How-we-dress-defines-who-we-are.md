I don't think so, my wife does and she has a point.

For me, my clothing is a statement, but it's just a statement for me to emphasize my beliefs.

My wife is an artist so she notices a couple of things

1. How are we seen in others' eyes and how does that affect us long term.
2. How we feel wearing certain clothing.

Long exposure to outside factors and internal struggles shapes our perspective, our well-being, our self, and our self-esteem how we see us and the world around us.
