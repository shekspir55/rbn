As an engineer, I strive to find engineering solutions to every problem surrounding me, engineering doesn't mean technical in this case. 

There are some problem which do not have engineering solutions, it's hard to understand.

Human solutions are what is missing. Human solutions are what is missing in our society, in software, in communities.

I really believe that as I've know that.
