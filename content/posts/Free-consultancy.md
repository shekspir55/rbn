Nobody buys it. When I provide it everyone is happy. 

Why?

Maybe people don't understand the offer, which is completely understandable. What I offer is hard to fit into a box. Or maybe my understanding of consultancy doesn't fit with real world problems or offers. Anyway, I'm always happy to help people. They see the value and that's what I need.

Does it scale well? Not yet, continuing to push the wagon on my own. But I know that after squicking ⚙️⚙️ gears will start turning. It needs a nudge.

Nobody said it would be quick or that path is easy. It never is.

If the path is easy, you are learning nothing.
