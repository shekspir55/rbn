When I started get-sms, which I failed 😀 I wrote  [They Probably Thought They Will Hire a Designer Once They Have Some Money 🖌️💸](/posts/they-probably-thought-they-will-hire-a-designer-once-they-have-some-money/) which I love.

Today I hired someone who should create a branding for my powered-by.love consultancy. I don't know how to package it, I don't know yet what words to use talking to people about the consultancy, but I will figure it out soon. 


# I want my brand to be about caring for and serving small software engineering teams.

Branding is a powerful part of communication, and it's not only about logo colors and merch.

# Brand is what you believe and what you stand for.

Ordering branding service is nice, but the brand is built over time with actions.
