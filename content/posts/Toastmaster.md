I was at a party another day, there was a toastmaster, he was doing his job.

# I'm not here to judge but to observe.

Toastmasters' direct motivation is so people get married sooner, and have more kids, as his job depends just on this fact.

His entire job is marketing and sales because if he does his job correctly his work will be noticed and he will have more clients. This process is definition of capitalism.
