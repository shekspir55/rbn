I need to introduce myself and busy people are willing to help me, but I need to write a forwardable message to "help them help me"

The structure is 

* Who I write with request
* Description of what I want to pass on

Here is how I do it.

        Hi XXXX,  I would like to ask you to introduce me to some people who might help find opportunities for  my "Software Engineering and Management consultancy".

        My consultancy(PBL) offers services that optimize server infrastructure, help hire  leadership and
        build technical teams, guide tech strategy and performance, modernize legacy systems, provide
        project management training, diagnose inefficiencies, solve key business challenges, support
        leadership development, tackle complex technical problems and reduce software costs by
        migrating to open-source solutions.

        Iâ€™m passionate about people and technology, with over 12 years of experience in software
        development and engineering leadership. 
        
        
        I believe in fostering collaborative environments,
        promoting continuous improvement, and empowering teams to take ownership of their work. My
        approach prioritizes flexibility, trust delegation, and empathetic leadership, which helps me build
        strong relationships with both developers and clients.

        Thanks for all the help,

        Ruben
