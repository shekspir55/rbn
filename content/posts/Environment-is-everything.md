- What do we eat?
- Where do we walk?
- Who do we talk to every day?
- What do people around us believe in?
- When do you wake up?

You are more shaped by the environment around you than you might ever think. 

If we took any of us as babies and put them in the future, we would grow up as future humans. If we were born in another nation, another location, that would define who we are, and what we believe in.

This is described well in the book "Outliers". 

My surroundings identify me, I will continue to care about the people and things surrounding me daily, at work and in life. 

## Everything seems to be my choice, but it's probably also strongly influenced by my environment...

Are you not happy with where you stand right now? It's time to change the environment, people around you, locations, and maybe a job. 

# You are not what you eat, but what you eat defines who you are.
