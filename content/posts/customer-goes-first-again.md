I wrote that I want to offer a consultancy service and know that the hero section of the website should sound something like this  "We donâ€™t only recommend solutions, but we own the results." meaning we implement them with you.

I was talking with Rick Kitagawa today and asking for his advice on running a consultancy. His advice was to "talk to your customers first, identify their problems". I've probably heard this a million times. But this is a trap I keep falling into, again and again, trying to propose a solution beforehand. It's probably easier for me but I should overcome this.

I know who I want to survey. It's small/medium companies and teams who struggle with technical seniority, processes, and work organization and don't want to hire multiple people to solve their problems. Something like "Fractional CTO" with management and operations included.

This is what I want to see as my customers. First I will need to find more of them, and ask to know their problems better, so I can create tailored solutions for them.
