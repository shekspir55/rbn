For me it's always about how can I help people, if I can't or if my help is insufficient I would not push. 

I will push to know the reason why?


Why isn't it sufficient? Why can't I help you? Is that personal or professional? I just need to know, I need to constantly improve, and the only way for me to do so is feedback.

So anytime you see me, the best gift would be giving feedback about any matter, no fluff, straight feedback. 

# It's the best present for me to know that what I do matters.
