Putting yourself in the world is even harder. Consistency is hard. 

Knowing that when it comes to humans there may be no one to ask for the right answer. I think the key is collaboration with others. 

If there is no right answer probably working with others may help to find a better one, at least a shared one.

I know that whatever I'm doing is a game, where you cannot win. But the process makes it even more interesting.

I know that the journey is much more important than the destination. We don't know how much closer we go towards our destination but I know that consistency is the key.

# Slow and consistent is a good start.
