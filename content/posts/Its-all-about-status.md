What is a status definition for me?
- It's a way to measure acknowledgment, by one or many parties. In most cases, we assign labels to statuses.

Status even can come from within, when you assign one to yourself.

Status can be as simple as calling someone
- Junior
- Software Engineer
- Father
- Freelancer
- Or even "My Love"
 
Though I have some achievements in life, today I was acknowledged as "not a beginner" in a field where I was considering myself a beginner. My "teacher" told me that, and at that moment I was very happy.

# Even though it didn't affect me in any way yet, it was all about acknowledgment and status.
