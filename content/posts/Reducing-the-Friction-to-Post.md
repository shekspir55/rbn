Eliminating the reasons I don't blog, one by one. 

Opening the editor is a friction, writing is a friction, pushing is a friction, but I can make it as easy as possible.

Last couple of days I was trying to blog on my phone, it's a bit challanging with my current tech setup, I've tried all solutions except XTERM becauses I thought it will also create friction.

## Approaching from another angel.

* Today I've setup a command "blog" when I write it it will open my editor.
* "make new" will prompt me to enter the post name and will put the draft to false, things I did for years manully.
* "make push" will create commuit and push automatically, this isn't prod server for multimilion users, so this will work

Let's see what other excuses I have not to write tomorrow.
