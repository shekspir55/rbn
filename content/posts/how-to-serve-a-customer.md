Some of you know I have a consultancy https://powered-by.love (website is under construction) which provides consulting services as well as services for fractional CTO roles.

I believe that the only way to have any customers is to deeply care about their problems, and not what I can offer them. 

My offer can be flexible, but I need to understand my customers' issues first, care about them, and suggest tailored solutions to implement them, customers could modify my proposal.

# there are no "standard" solutions.

This is what I sell, this is why people trust me.
