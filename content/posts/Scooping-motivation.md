For me, motivation is being on the edge. I need to feel that what I do is important to do, at that exact moment. (Probably because of my ADHD)

There is a YouTube channel called "How to ADHD," and they say the urgency is involved in moving. For me, it's 100%. I need something urgent so I can start moving. 

That's why "quitting" the job is essential for me. It's a way to always be on the edge of hunger and uncertainty. 

## I am eternally grateful to all the people who support me along my very tedious journey. I'm thankful to my friends, my family, my wife, and little Viewnick, who doesn't understand what changes are happening in his father's life.

# And you who is here, whoever or wherever you are, thank you for reading this and making my work matter.
