It's exhausting. 

Picking up a child constantly during the day, it's intensive physical labor + not sleeping = being continually tired, I will try to sleep earlier today, so I will recover a bit more.

Dear mother, today is not Mother Day, but I want to acknowledge the work you do is enormous in terms of labor, emotional work as well and responsibility.

Will practice this for 5 more days, I want to see where this will take me. 

Taking care of the baby is very rewarding.
