I think Seth Godin said it but I can't find a direct quote, it sounded something like this "Work is what you try to do less of, Art is what you try to do more of". 
I consider myself an artist though I'm not perceived as one.

### As I said before, I cannot work on things I don't care about.

# I ship my best work when I care about what I do and than it becomes art.

And I feel that every day when I do what I like, I think about it day and night. I try to find solutions when no one asks me to. I can talk about it for hours.

# And when the magic✨ is gone, it's gone.
It it might happen because
* The meaningful work is complete
* Something went wrong in the initial agreement, and now we are doing something that we didn't agree on

It's time to see things from another angle and move on to the next step.

# Off topic about art:
When I have free time, I create SVG art with my favorite tool Inkscape. 

### I've made those 2 Armenian poem-rugs today.
