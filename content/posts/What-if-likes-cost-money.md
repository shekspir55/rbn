I have a crazy stupid startup idea that I will probably never do but I wanted to share it with you. And maybe it's already done somewhere.

Likes and reactions are worthless, they only affect your emotions and ego, and they also make algorithms work. 

### Now picture a social media where you subscribe for 10$ a month and every time you react the money is sent to the cause balance. At the end of the month, money is divided equally among projects you have reacted to.

- Would you still "like" everything you see?
- Will those causes benefit from it? Because now it's not just like, every impression is direct money.
- Will there be influencers, and would those influencers be the best people in the world? Or maybe the best fundraisers?

# This seems to be a social media where you are not the product, but a generous donor.
