- We feel secure if we are employed.
- We think that if we lock the door, no stranger will come inside.
- We feel that wars are always far away unless they are happening to us right now.
- We think that money we hold cache, in banks, or crypto, will help us in hard times. However, there are countless examples when it's not the case.- Most of us are unprepared for stress and change, but it always happens.

Critical thinking should be taught in schools. Math helps us with that a little, though there are problems with general education worldwide.

# We are never secure unless we have control over controllables, and that is the change I'm willing to commit.
