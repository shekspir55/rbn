# What is money?
For some it's freedom. Freedom of choice.
For me it's an equivalent of "ability". It's like the magic wand with a charge, in the world where magic doesn't exist.

# What would you do if it wasn't for money?

Let's say you have all the "abilities". What would you do? Would you go the same job? Will you do what you do now?

"What if" scenario is almost always fake, as the world is as it is, and we cannot make it change by assuming things.

But this is a exercise to understand, if what you do is what you want to do.

# For me the only value I can create is helping people. And having fun with technology along the way.
