Change always meets resistance. If there is no resistance there is not enough change.


The biggest problem we have now is the trust issues, I don't trust them, and they don't trust me. This is completely normal given the circumstances.


Today I have tried another way. I tried to bring an alliance to solve the conflict, the person who may be more unbiased than me.

It somehow went through, but it's not so simple.

Alliance being somewhat unbiased has a fresh perspective and can facilitate dialogue. We will see where this goes until then.

# Keep calm and continue making changes every day.
