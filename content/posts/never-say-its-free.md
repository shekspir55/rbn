My consultancy https://powered-by.love/ has a "Love Guarantee" which means that if in a month of our service for any reason, you are not satisfied with what I offer, I will walk out no questions asked, without taking a payment.

# Which means it's "free"? Not sure.

## Here me out

The guarantee is a way to tell the world, that I know the value I will deliver. It's the way of saying my customer will not walk out on me if I can help him, and if I he does that's not my customer, and it's better to know from the beginning.

Emerge went well, I even posted 2 photos to LinkedIn which is a progress for me. :) I have networked with a bunch of cool people, tomorrow is the last day, and I will try to make the most out of this day.
