Long time no blog.

WTF is happening?

Writing a blog is too important for me, when I don't write a blog I don't analyze as much. 
Sometimes I write fast blogs, which are just composed in place and the meaning of that is just to continue pushing. But it's not what I want to do.

I want to spend time, processing my thoughts.

### About consultancy
I understand now that consultancy can help businesses that are in the middle of transformation. I understand that now, there are no other cases. People need to feel the pain and almost know the answer, and we will bring the expertise, so that's that.

When I look back, I don't understand how I got here. I have many connections with people who felt very distant from me a while ago, people who wouldn't even consider talking to me in the past, this is the journey. I quit my comfort zone a while ago, and maybe that's why it's so hard for me to continue. But I keep showing up, I keep pushing.


### Things to do before the new year.
1. pass the Gallup test
2. READ and think about: The Leader's Guide to Corporate Culture: How to Manage the Eight Critical Elements of Organizational Life - Explore the company cultures - https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53726
3. finalize the analysis of the "mom test"


P.S. Thank you to my wife arevikaroyan.com (her website) that encourages me to move forward every day and that she helped me to start writing again. "To start writing again you need to put just a '.' in your blog, rest will come."
