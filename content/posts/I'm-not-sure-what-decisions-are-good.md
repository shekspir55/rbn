Every time, I write a blog post I see people engaging, but I can never guess which post is good, or which post will resonate with people. That is not the point of my blog.

Today I talked to many people and told them what I do.

And when I thought I was meeting another great person I found a gem. I found a person who understood me from the first word.

Keep trying, meet people, and keep exposing yourself, success will come from enough iterations and refinements, you will never know when you will make a good decision, but making a lot of them increases your chances.
