It's almost 28 hours.üòÖ

Yesterday I started a challenge to create an open-source microsoftr = micro + softr.

The point was that I didn't need a full database for many landing pages but I wanted a simple cms that could work with only frontend pages and Google spreadsheets as DB would be just enough.

### Is this software complete? YES
### Is it final? NO

# What else should be done?
Implement, good error handling, and write simple documentation for usage with examples. Host the app, and ask for donations.

### Now about test-driven development.

# I started using TDD a year ago and I cannot go back.

Yes, it's time-consuming, and it adds almost 30% time overhead to the project, BUT, without it you will have a hell of a time testing the app, over and over and over and over and over again, to make sure it works. And it will still not work perfectly, even with TDD, but it makes it much easier. 

### You will thank yourself later for doing regression testing.

### You can check out the microsoftr
