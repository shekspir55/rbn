This blog post is either a startup idea or, an idea to join existing structure.

Blender is all over the place. It's in movies, in cartoons, in games. It's a go-to choice for people starting their career in 3d. 

A couple of years ago that wasn't the case, so what changed?

For software engineers, it was a change from 2.79 to 2.8. For the rest of the world, it was a change in understanding of the software.

I hope I will interview people from the Blender Foundation and ask them their opinion, my opinion is they listened to what people needed and had a great UX team. Of course not without funding.

Oh, do you know that the blender is **free** and **open source**?

**Open source** has the potential to change the world in unexpected ways, so which software is the next Blender? 

I hope it's **Inkscape**. I see it's big potential. It's software similar to Adobe Illustrator or Figma, it's vector art software that is simple has all the functionalities you need, and in my opinion, has a grandiose potential.

If Inkscape is not willing to with this route anyone who believes in it can do it instead of them, as it's also free and **open source**. So either join them or fork them.

It can potentially be compiled to wasm and be run in the browser, anyway your heart desires it. This is the power of **open source**.

To be continued, someday...
