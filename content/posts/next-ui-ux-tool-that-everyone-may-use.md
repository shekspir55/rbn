This blog post is either a startup idea or, an idea to join existing structure.

Blender is all over the place. It's in movies, in cartoons, in games. It's a go-to choice for people starting their career in 3d. 

A couple of years ago that wasn't the case, so what changed?


![blender 2.79 vs 2.8](/images/next-ui-ux-tool-that-everyone-may-use/1717506512606.png)

For software engineers, it was a change from 2.79 to 2.8. For the rest of the world, it was a change in understanding of the software.

I hope I will interview people from the Blender Foundation and ask them their opinion, my opinion is they listened to what people needed and had a great UX team. Of course not without funding.

Oh, do you know that the blender is **free** and **open source**?

**Open source** has the potential to change the world in unexpected ways, so which software is the next Blender? 

I hope it's **Inkscape**. I see it's big potential. It's software similar to Adobe Illustrator or Figma, it's vector art software that is simple has all the functionalities you need, and in my opinion, has a grandiose potential.

If Inkscape is not willing to go with this route, anyone who believes in it can make it a reality, as it's also free and **open source**. 

### So either join them or fork them. (better join them of course)

It can potentially be compiled to wasm and be run in the browser, anyway your heart desires it. This is the power of **open source**.

To be continued, someday...

# UPD
Also a reminder that I will start soon a podcast with [open source founders and startups](/posts/starting-yet-another-podcast), so please let me know if you can suggest any idea for podcast name and maybe tell me if there are any people you would like to ask questions, and what format would you like to see in this podcast?
