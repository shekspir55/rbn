Today, I dropped my car key in a compartment of my car.

I spent almost 2 hours trying to fetch them, but I couldn't, I didn't have the tools.

My friend went to a master and fetched the tools to disassemble the frame. After which we saw the keys but couldn't grab them.

Finally, the master arrived with a "flexible grabber pickup tool" and fetched it in 10 seconds.

Total time spent - 2 hours 20 minutes and 10 seconds. 
Useful time spent - 20 minutes and 10 seconds.

# The right tool may be the only blocker from achieving the goal.
