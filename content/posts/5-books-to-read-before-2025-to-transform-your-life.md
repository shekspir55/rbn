People are not computers, though we share traits such as short and long-term memory or processing power.

You cannot install a "software" or an "operating system" into your brain by reading a book and suddenly start acting completely differently.

Instead, I think the viable approach would be to read a book as a case study, discuss it with "friends," and *start acting* in a way that reflects the change you want to make in your life.

Reading is good, it changes our minds and opinions just slightly, but it's not enough of an effort. Focus on being consistent.
