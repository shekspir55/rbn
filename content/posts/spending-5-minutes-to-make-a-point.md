This blog post is an exercise. I want to make a point, and for that, I will need to do some research and tell a story.

# Telling a story
Henry Ford was not the first person to invent cars.

He was an engineer at Edison Illuminating Company, where he began experimenting with gasoline in his free time. Soon he founded his company and soon became the largest producer of cars in the US.

But they say that although he was very technical, he couldn't even read blueprints of the engines and transmissions he was designing. 

Henry Ford was a generalist, he understood how the business works, how to create an assembly line, how to dig deeper, and he had brilliant engineers who made his projects a reality.

Sometimes ignorance is a blessing.

## The point: a generalist needs to work with specialists
