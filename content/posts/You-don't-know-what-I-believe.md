And this is the problem because if you did we wouldn't ask me, so I  need to write this so people understand my point, and how wrong I am. I genuinely think so.

I think that employer-developer relationship should be seamless. I think we should understand each other better to collaborate. I think there are connections to be made to make our work better to help each other. I think there is an opportunity for people who believe that employees should work as hard as they can because they understand and share their employers struggles. And employers should know all the pains of their employees because otherwise, people don't want to help each other.

I know that my dream is achievable and I'm willing be the medium of this idea.
