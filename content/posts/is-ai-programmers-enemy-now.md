We may think AI is taking all the jobs, but it's not true.

### I tried Copilot and it's an awesome tool for developers, unfortunately, a proprietary one.


# The villain is recession

In times of recession, we can find many villains but the only thing that is bad now is the market. The market cannot afford new solutions.

Those who are new in the market may panic and think that everything is bad and it won't recover. Well, it will. It might not be the same market but it will be a good market nonetheless.

## Recessions happen from time to time and later everything recovers.

How I see AI in a new market is quite simple: AI will help to have smaller teams. People will be able to ship to the market faster with fewer resources.

## But what I think we don't often talk about is no-code applications.

Nocode is awesome. It allows people without technical backgrounds to create sites, automation, platforms and monetize them.

# No code is what programmers should be afraid of :D
