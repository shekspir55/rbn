To become a taxi driver, you must possess a driver's license, purchase a car for at least 2500 EURO, maintain the vehicle, buy fuel, and pay fees.

A single ride in Stepanavan, regardless of the starting and ending points, costs a fixed 1 EURO (approximately 500 USD).

A man who bought a kid's car (a rideable electric vehicle) for 200 EURO operates on the city square, charging 1 EURO for a ride around the square. This short journey covers roughly 200 meters. This business model has no fees, expensive cars, maintenanc cost, and the risk of accidental harm to others

# Is the Kids' Car Business 10 Times More Profitable Than Taxi?

I think there are 3 things we should consider:

- Taxi is a necessity, kids' car is a leisure activity. People with little money will not afford it, but they will use taxi.
- Kids' car is seasonal - only works in summer and good weather, when we have enough tourism. Where taxi works best when the weather is bad.
- In the short term, kids' car is much more profitable; in the long term, maybe not so much
