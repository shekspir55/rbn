It was raining heavily in Lori for more than a week nonstop. Our backyard is flooded. when you put a foot on the ground water splashes around it.

We went for a walk in the morning, and we saw that it was bursting water from the electric lamp panel. I called the municipality and told them about the issue, they told me that they knew about it, and they are waiting for electricians to fix this.

Later that day, my friend called me and asked me if we were ok and if we were somehow affected by the flood. I was not aware of the flood.

Apparently cities and villages near us are flooded. People lost lives and homes. This is a national tragedy.

So I thought, did the municipality worker know about the flood? Maybe what was my struggle, wasn't theirs as they saw a bigger one.

I hope there are no more people injured. Keep yourselves safe.
