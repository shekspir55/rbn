I will go to conferences, and talk to people, introduce my services, and what I can do for them, I hope I will find words to wrap my thoughts around them.

I commit that I will
- I will do photos to memorize and make posts about them
- I will talk to all kinds of people, and I will try to be as less biased as possible
- I will not commit to anything I'm not sure I can lift, the quality for me is really important

# Let's see where this rabbit hole goes.

------------

Was not posting due to the cause that I was sick and busy with personal staff.

It's so much harder and so much easier to blog than before. It's hard to choose from topics, but I know the answer I have a system for that. I will choose the one I like and if there are no favorites: I will iterate and reiterate‚Ä§
