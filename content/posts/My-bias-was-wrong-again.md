Today, I found a professional who specializes in secondary water treatment. My bubble intuition told me that there were probably no people in Armenia doing this as a career. At first, I thought he was just another construction company owner. Oh boy, I was wrong. 

## And I'm happy I was wrong.

I had assumptions and biases, that did not correlate with reality. The person had 26 years of experience in the water treatment industry.

Assuming it is probably ok, there are a lot of unconscious biases in place, but it's always better to ask otherwise our bubble will not expand.
