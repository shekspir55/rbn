We are not in a hot war right now, but it's always over the corner.
Many countries are in hot wars at this moment, what do they tell us? What would they if they knew what they knew before the war started?

Are we using our piece time to time to be more prepared?

I always think I do, but every time I see that, it's not enough! We must do as much as possible to avoid war and be prepared when it eventually starts and knocks on our doors, again.
