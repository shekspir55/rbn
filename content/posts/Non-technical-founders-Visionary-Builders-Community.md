This is my third community. I'm starting to understand how it works.

People with similar interests or challenges tend to have similar insights and views on issues. They share their insights and experiences, and soon they feel connection and empathy.

## Is this my legacy? Building communities?
I have no idea what I'm doing, thought I feel that a lot of people who are into this buisness need me or expertice.

## Not CTOs though :D
CTOs need me only to organize the events and add them to these channels. But nothing more at the moment. My technical expertise is not enough for them probably?

I helped 2 technical founders with my services. 1 with their CI/CD and the other with engineering processes.

Not sure I can help other CTOs or if they need my services at all.
