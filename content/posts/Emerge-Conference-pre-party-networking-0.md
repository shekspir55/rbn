I went to Emerge, it's tough to network with people you don't know, so this time I had the following strategy.

1. Approach a person who stands alone
2. Introduce myself, just my name
3. Ask their name and what they do
4. Try to help them with my connection and expertise if possible, be genuinely involved with what they are saying, participate in conversation as much as possible, ask questions
5. introduce myself

Let's call this framework an RBN framework:DD .

I haven't tried it with larger groups, so let's see what I will bring tomorrow and the next day. 

# Today, I've made connections with a lot of good people.
