Today I went to 4 IRL meetings, I got connected to 10 new people to tell about the Instepanavan Development Foundation instepanavan.am .

I went to talk to them without any expectations, just to put ourselves and our work into the world with the question "How can we help you? We are your ambassadors on the site."

They gave us a lot of valuable advice, like that we shouldn't limit ourselves to a narrow niche as there is a lot of cometition and suggested another niche and that we need to talk with even more people.

The last meeting was one of the best once, we have just talked about what we have and what can do for them, and though I didn't have any expectations we got an offer to work with eachother.

This is very powerfull, not expecting anything and to get people who want to with you.
