If you would ask me a couple of years ago what is the most valuable asset I have it would probably be "knowledge", "languages".Back then I thought that people didn't need universities and could learn everything by themselves.

Now I think otherwise.

# I think the most valuable asset is the network.

People you talk with daily, people who are in the present, people who are in the past.

The university is status, the university is another network. So probably you should study somewhere which will give you knowledge, status and network.

# I'm grateful to know all of you!
