## What's about it?
I host Armenian CTO Community. We have already 109 members there. First event hosted 21 members! I am doing this for over 9 months now. 

The tension is real. It's hard to organize events, it's hard to write people you don't know. I know it will pay back. Don't when or how, but I keep pushing.

## The place
I don't know where I will host it, probably in fabula, hope that I will have at least 40 members this time. 

# Why do I do it?
To make the difference in Armenian tech. To make collaborations. To eduacte.

## Where do you get the money for the event?
I have no idea, but we'll figure out something goinh forward.
