I appreciate all the comments I've received.

- Obviously, the idea was raw, it was bad, and there was no user research done.
- Slack is an amazing product, and it can do almost anything as it's people talking to people, it can replace Jira, and Trello, and even act as software version control storage but it's good at serving communication.
- I think that Ideas shouldn't resonate with everyone.  If a person thinks I wasted one time, it's probably because I did. It's not for everyone. It's hard to hear that you wasted everyone's time, I'm grateful to receive this feedback.
- Oculus probably can solve problems I see but also not everyone owns Oculus.
- I certainly need to talk to the Lucky Carrot founder.
- CSGO, poker, etc... are not for everyone, in my team not everyone loved having game sessions. But everyone enjoyed virtual team building. 
- Making HR or organizer use another tool is a real pain, and I don't know if my tool is useful. I need to do research.
- It's hard presenting without slides, everyone has an image in their head. I need to be better at this.

What are my next steps? Easy, to do user interviews, understand the pain points try to solve their issues without my product. tell them they are right for not using my product and understand their views.

Once again, I'm in the dip and it cannot hold me.ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ
