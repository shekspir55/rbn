We were doing decluttering today. It was hard, it was 8 hours of continuous work. It was too hard.

Change is scary, FOMO is real, what if I need this paper? Where do I find it again and will I remember it?

But in the end, it's too much fun. I cannot wait to do it again, it's hard but fulfilling, and it opens up a space in our surroundings and hands.

Noticing things is a skill I'm picking up slowly.
