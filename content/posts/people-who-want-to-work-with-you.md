A kid from our youth center came to me and told me that she wanted to do SMM for us.

I asked her, what do you do?
she told me, "photos, and movies", and hell that are movies, it is something special.

I cannot believe I found a gem like this.

 But what is more important for me, it's the approach. I didn't search for this person, she wasn't looking on Linkedin, this was something natural because she did something I needed and I made an impression of a person with whom working can be fun.

These are relations I value, these are relationships that are lasting. People wanting to work with other people not for money but for their values.
