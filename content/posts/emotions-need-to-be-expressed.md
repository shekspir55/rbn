2 days in a row I talk to friends and family members, who are suppressing their emotions. The result of this is emotional burnout, depression, and physical illnesses.

I believe suppression is a cultural phenomenon, something coming from generations, probably from the Soviets or beyond.

I cannot recommend enough looking into the works of Gabor Mate.

### Wish we all could feeling any emotions and express them.

# Hope we can fix this for our future generations.
