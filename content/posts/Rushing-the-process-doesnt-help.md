I've started too late, because of that I have more knowledge from the field. I have been learning these past 4 years, but starting something by oneself is hard. When you are alone, it's even harder.

The gear started squicking, it's not turning yet, but I can hear the sound.

The question is "Am I doing the right thing?" and "Can I do something else, that will bring me more results". 

The answer to these questions will come with experience, with meeting new people.
If I would have started over, I would just start earlier. 

That would have allow me to be more flexible and have more freedom.
