This couple of days I was going to Emerge. And this is what I learned. 

I've created the framework of how to approach people and when you want to meet them it's simple it is a couple of steps I have written about in this blog. https://rbn.am/posts/emerge-conference-pre-party-networking-0/

So apparently what works is just talking to people, just being generally curious on how they feel and what they do, all my amtMBA friends and colleagues I would suggest just going to events and meeting people. It helps because you can use the same skills you discovered during your ultimate journey.

All people are people.

I would go to other conferences to talk to people again soon. In the meantime I have 3-4 podcasts to do next week. https://www.youtube.com/@Powered.Podcast

I have tremendous amount of work to do, so let's start.
