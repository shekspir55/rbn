In this era of increasing attention-grabbing, notifications, phones, and politics which all have some degree of influence on our lives it's tough to be responsible.

All this TikTok, YouTube shorts, LinkedIn videos, algorithms, and every giant corporation is made to grab your attention.

And Telegram advertises itself as not having algorithms, and now your attention is screwed even more, there is no priority.

For me it's simple if I see a message I should read, I should see 0 notifications, 0 messages. Otherwise, I will ignore everything. I unsubscribe from as much media as possible so I can finally focus.

Please take a break, talk to people, and ask them how they feel.
