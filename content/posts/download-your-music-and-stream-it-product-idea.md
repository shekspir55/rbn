- Ever thought you could stream your songs offline?
- Can you still download music? MP3, WAW?
- Ever thought that there is a world outside Spotify?

## Apparently answer to all these questions is YES

# Stream your media?
I wrote a blog about [nextcloud](/posts/Configuring-own-homebrew-server-part-2-regain-control-of-your-data-secure-alternatives-to-Google-drive-iCloud-1Password-Spotify-and-more) and having your own media streaming service. I stream the music and audiobooks that I buy.

# Can you still download music? MP3, WAW?
There are a couple of websites you can do that, I know a few.
1. [audiobookstore](https://audiobookstore.com/) for downloading audiobooks
   1. Also there is a hack on how to convert audiobooks from Amazon and remove DRM.
2. [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) Here you can buy and download music, can you imagine?
     1. Also this is a better way to use music as most of the money from the purchase goes to the artist.
     2. Buying albums in most cases is much cheaper.


# Ever thought that there is a world outside Spotify?

You know, streaming is not my thing, though I continue canceling and resubscribing to Spotify. But I like the idea of inheriting the media I purchased to my children.

All these products/companies someday die out or become evil corps and all your data [is gone forever](https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityTrain/comments/17fyvbc/as_of_october_25th_2023_infinity_train_is_being/). Well, this is of course not for everyone, but I know few people who will agree.

This is a product Idea which I probably will not do. but who knows?

# What if you set a budget, for buying music from Bandcamp, and the application fetches your favorite tracks for a month from Spotify and suggests buying them on a monthly basis so you recreate your digital collection without spending huge money at once.

## It's like a subscription but you own what you bought!

This is the idea, I know this is not mainstream, but it could be nice to have it for me, so someday I will **quit streaming completely**.
