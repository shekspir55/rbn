Last week was awful, I didn't have time to breathe.

This week is not much better. But we have progress.

I have about 3k impressions in 2 days on LinkedIn, which should help brand awareness. I have 8 podcasts, now, and scheduled some for the next week and the week after that.


I want to record an intro video for YouTube and our website, so people entering our website know, what we do :)

I might start live podcasts, as they require less effort but allow for more real experience:) Not sure yet.

I need to talk to people in real life, I need to attend events, and I help the 3nn website so I can finally see how many events are there.

My child just broke my wife's keyboard, so we need to understand how are we going forward with this.:)
