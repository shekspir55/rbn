I was talking to my wife recently about https://get-sms.app, and she asked 

\- don't you want to hire a designer for it? 

For which my answer was, 

\- I will, once I have some revenue from it.💅🏻



Yesterday we went to the store, and I was looking at different candy packaging. And thinking, if you want someone to buy your product, why will you have this design of the package and not that?

Why is one design superior to another, while everyone can see the difference?

I asked my wife, about her opinion. She replied, 

/- They probably thought they would hire a designer once they have some money.


Though I understand that we need to have the best designs we can. It's also very important to communicate the value the user is getting through design, it's important to not create unrealistic expectations or to think of ways to live up to them.
