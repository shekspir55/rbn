Well, it happened. The food was sushi, and people came with friends, some just checking in. I was so glad to see so many people I know and don't know.

It's a huge milestone for me, it makes my work tangible. And when you see people's faces and touch them IRL.

What's next? Improve the quality of podcasts, and create RSS podcasts. Add it to Spotify and Apple Music. 

And keep shipping.

Thank you for being a part of this journey!
