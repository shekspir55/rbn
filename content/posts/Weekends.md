Yesterday, I spent the day picking pears and sleeping. Today, I spent the day caring for the baby and trying to rest; I can't rest with a small baby.

But I need this. Even these "activities" help me unplug from the world mentally. We need to have time to stop doing things, to stop scrolling, to stop thinking, to just exist now. I would love to have more time to read some books. 

Maybe I will trade some of my time here and there to make up more room for reading more books.
