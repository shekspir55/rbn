Not my best work or even close. It doesn't matter if what I write is good, but it's desirable, otherwise, it's just doing for just doing. But I feel that for me consistency is what matters.

What I would like to write is, about making replicating blender success on inkscape. I'm too tired for that today.

And as you are reading this, please help suggest me any names for my [open-source podcast](/posts/starting-yet-another-podcast). The idea is to interview people who have built careers with podcasts and to share their experience with us, and maybe help us to get on track. I want to make it interactive and allow the audience to ask questions to my guests beforehand, and then ask the questions also afterwards.
