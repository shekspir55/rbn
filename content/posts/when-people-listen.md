Today I was in a meeting today.

- I was complaining about products and they listened.
- I was suggesting changes to the product and they listened.
- I was talking about my imagined solutions and they listened.

This was active listening with suggestions, no accusations no defending just active listening.

# I'm glad to meet professionals who are doing this job good and are listening.

I hope I don't interrupt people too much, if I do, please tell me. I need to improve.
