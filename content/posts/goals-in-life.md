Do you have a plan for the future? I'm not asking about a realistic one as the world is too volatile now  I probably ask, do you have a vision?

A couple of years ago I was drifting, I thought I understood what I wanted and the answer was money. Is that a goal? Not sure.

Now I know, I want to change the world, starting from my city and community. For that, I need a couple of things

1. Vision
2. Connections
3. A lot of money
3. Will

Without these 4 I won't go anywhere.

Please share your humble or not-so-humbly goals for life.
