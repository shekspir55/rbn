I am involved in a project, where I bought shares for 7K, and it's failing fast. I'm not alone, and many people are losing their money in this project.

What did I understand from this expensive failure?

- You are always buying problems though and are tempted with benefits. So you better investigate the potential problems first. Go to meetings where they discuss the issues.
- When many people are involved in the project there should be 1 person who will commit to the responsibility. We thought we had this at first, but the commitment was diluted.
- Like anything in life, risks are present, and if you don't know people well, you don't know the project well, if there are transparency issues, there will always be issues, so notice those first.

# Communication issue is THE key. 

I love making expensive mistakes, that teach me big lessons.
