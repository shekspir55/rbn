I am fascinated that some successful businesses may not know or understand their customers.

It happens when user feedback doesn't reach the decision-maker or when a customer feels unheard. When not everyone is involved in marketing. When there are strict hierarchies.

When there is no ownership. No business should be like this, not the successful ones, but probably they have other values to offer. 

I hope whatever I will make will listen to customers with care. I will do everything to achieve that. Customer needs always need to be placed first.
