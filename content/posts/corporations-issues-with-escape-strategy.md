YouTube is lagging on my Firefox on Linux, I think it's done on purpose, I think Google knows the power of YouTube on their lives and tries to make us switch,

The only products that are buggy on my computer are once made by Google

My server, which is a tiny machine running open-source server software somehow doesn't lag, and when you use Chrome, it automatically fixes itself.

And don't tell me it's all Firefox, as everything else has excellent performance.
