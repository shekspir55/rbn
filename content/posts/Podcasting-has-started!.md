I have recorded yet [1 podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOBOWZ7I-sM) and have 12 subs on YouTube organically, and it's good. The secret is I was bringing traffic from LinkedIn and making shorts on YT. This strategy seems to be working scenario.

Upcoming 2 weeks I should do at least 4 more podcasts. It will be hard, but I'm pretty sure it's rewarding. 2 in Arm and 2 in En.

I would really appreciate it if you would tell me what would you hear in a podcast, which topics, and what language. 

The podcast is for tech people to make their work easier and better, to improve quality, and to educate themselves on tech and business.
