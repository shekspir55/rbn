Maybe it's bad luck but my refrigerator broke down, again.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I bought a Skyworth refrigerator, it broke last year. And here is my timeline with a cost breakdown of how much I spent on it so far.

Here is a fun timeline

* initial buying - 1000$
* After 2 years it broke down
  * buying a circuit A - 200$ - Didn't fix it
* After 2 month
  * buying circuit B - 100$ - Didn't fix it
* After a month
  * Buying a compressor - 350$
* It started to work but in 2 weeks stopped freezing.
  * replacing thermal heater - 20$
* it worked for a month and stopped freezing
  * Replacing chiller pipe - 20$
  * Replacing refrigerant - 20$
* It stopped working in a month,
* overall food wasted - 300$

On the contrary, my parents own a 19-year-old LG fridge, and it didn't break once.

And now I finally decided to replace it, why did I decide now?

Because I thought oh I spent so much money, I should continue investing in it starts working again, it's called sunk cost https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp . How would I understand if it was a sunk cost? The repair man told me it's gonna work, and it did for a while.

So the data was wrong, and after all, I don't need this refrigerator, I need the food not to spoil. This box doesn't do that job well, but these all are lessons that I learned.

There was another indicator I should have noticed before. There were no repair manuals online, the website did not exist. The guarantee for the product didn't have parts, even when ordered, there were no people around who could debug it. 

## I was so fascinated by the process of repair I probably didn't want to notice all these.

I don't regret anything, but now I see once more, that I should have stopped after the "Buying a compressor" step.
