There is a game of n-back, which helps with short-term memory improvement. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back

Yesterday I went to Tumanyan Shaurma, there was a guy taking orders and making shaurma.He remembered about 10 orders in the queue with preferences(without onion, without source, etc...). This is fascinating.

So this guy is not only a context-keeping machine, but he also is a 10back machine and I can't remember what I ate in the morning.

# We have a lot to learn from those around us.
