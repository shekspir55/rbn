I went to a local library to do another iteration of renovation and reimagination of the library. We are bringing new furniture and having an issue once again.

The library director said that they don't need furniture in one room, though we have had countless meetings discussing this. We have compromised many times but it was not enough.

To emphasize with her "I understand that she doesn't want and need a computer room. I understand that stopping us from doing the work at the very last moment is the only way she can reach her desired outcome.". But I also understand that we are not going to play this game, as I have 5 commitments to other people, to their bosses/municipality, community.

# My solution is not conflict it's just to go to decision makers and make that change. Not for me but for the community.
