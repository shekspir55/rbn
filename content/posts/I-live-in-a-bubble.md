- I believe that I know the best. 
- I believe that the best people surround me. 
- I believe that I can change a small part of the world, and I hope that it will cause a chain reaction.
- I believe that the world is a bad place, but around good people, it's not so bad.
- I know that education is important.
- I know that trying new things is hard.
- I know that change is hard.
- I have political opinions.
- I have a lot of biases.
