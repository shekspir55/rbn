I find myself suggesting the right solutions, right for me. And when I see that the pattern doesn't match, I get sad. 

It's hard to acknowledge that, that what I want to give and what needed are very very different things.

So I start listening more, for needs and wants. And provide solutions for them.

I will get better, I just need time and experience.
