My mentor probably doesn't know she is my mentor. And I understood some things. I did a lot of analysis. She told me about the start stop and continue framework. So this is the outcome.

# Start
- Investing more into the quality of my content online, not just quantity. I will reduce the amount of shorts and will put 
- Put measurability and goals for my SMM specialist
- Create customer profiles
- Slow down and focus

# Stop
- hassling and panic
- ignoring TikTok as a platform

# continue
- shipping every day, doing things consistently
- engaging with my community
- creating podcasts and improving quality
- caring about things I do and people I meet

I would love to see your start, stop, and continue for yourself as a practice in the comments.
