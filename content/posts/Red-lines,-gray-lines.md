Imagine you went to a pool
There are some good things, like 

- good renovation
- clean water

There are some issues

- Hangers are loose and fall out.
- The shower curtains are ripped.
- The water is a bit cold.
- lockers do not have a key.
- the ceiling is a bit melted.

And there are breakers

- The water is dirty, you can see it only once you are in the water
The administration told you to come with a swimming hat, but for some reason, you are the only one.

So would you go there? My and your red lines might radically vary, we might live in different places and have access to other facilities. Our needs and views may be different.

# My gray lines may be broad, but what I expect from the swimming pool is clean water and common rules.
