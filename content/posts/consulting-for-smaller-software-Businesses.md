## I will increase ownership and productivity among employees.

I have 12 years of experience in the software engineering field. I am starting a consulting business, but not a simple one. I want it to serve remote or hybrid small software engineering companies. 

# I've done it before and I am doing it again.

## What will I do?

- Help smaller teams and companies who struggle with technical leadership, management, operations, automation skills, testing, and online team building.
- 
- Not only find issues but also implement the solutions, so it's not just promises.
  - Set up healthy management and leadership(also technical).
  - Set up documentation practices.
  - Set up solid testing use cases.
  - Train Leaders and managers.
  - Do PR reviews.
  - Helping with CI/CD.
  - Technical estimation with teams.
  - etc...

This process is done by collaborating with the team. My team will learn your technologies, we speak your language, analyze your customer's needs and find tailored solutions. We will optimize your processes, and if we cannot help you we will tell you.

# And this is all just for 4K per month. 20 hours weekly. No surprises.
