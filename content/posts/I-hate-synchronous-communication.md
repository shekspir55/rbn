It's becoming more and more difficult to focus in this highly distractive world. A lot of noise and buzz, and groups and channels, and apps and data...

If I see a number indicator showing unread messages on lost phone calls in my phone's notification panel I want to read everything so it becomes 0. It's especially difficult with all the different synchronous communication platforms and also with phone calls.

I have uninstalled Telegram from my phone, I have disabled notifications on WhatsApp and similar apps.

It feels like sometimes there is no escape. 

Though email is. Email allows you to look at the message tomorrow, open it, and mark it unread. To sort into directories. 

You don't need to have 15 different apps for emails, you can have 1 manager for all your accounts like Thunderbird or even mobile Gmail. It allows you to host your server, and store your data and gives you a real choice.

I would love it if more people communicated with me via email and allowed me to focus.
