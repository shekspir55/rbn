Lately I have been fascinated with behavior and behavioral changes.

Recently, my wife proposed to put color collars on stray dogs near our house.
The thing is, we don't have a problem with dogs, we have problems with people treating dogs poorly. The thought was, if we put collars on dogs, humans will think they have owners and are not aggressive, thus, treating dogs better.

What we saw was fascinating.

Not only did people start to treat dogs better, but dogs became more calm and trusted by humans.

# Maybe I see what I want to see, or maybe this too is deeply interconnected.
