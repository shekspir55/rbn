I love doing them. Today was the second episode, and it was a good one, I have 2 more next week and we'll see what happens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQ7b6BVkd4

What else I need to do is, create a Podcast about "successful open source" to make my contribution to the world of open source I already have 2 awesome planned guests, I need some time.

I also need to do podcasts for instepanvan.am as it will help to promote the channel.
