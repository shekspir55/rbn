Do you want to buy an ad on my blog? You can't and you never will be.

This blog is not intended to serve anyone's commercial success(maybe except mine when I share my projects), just to document my journey as I try to write every day. 

This helps me to organize ideas in my head, to try out different titles, to try to analyze during the day, so I have something to write in the evening.

I've been doing this for about 3 months, but my analytical skills have improved, and I can notice it. My empathy level has increased not without the help of wonderful altMBA.

Writing is one of my ways of self expression.
