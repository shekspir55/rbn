When I worked at Crossover, in my first team, I spent 40% of my workday in video calls with engineers to take over the project. 
60% of the time: learning all the technologies they use.

I asked my manager
- Should I track learning time?
- Yes, learning is a part of your job. - manager replied.

And it always is, but we don't think about it that way. We are constantly learning in our workplaces, and most of the time don't notice it.

# So the question is not if learning is part of the job, but how can we make it more productive and organized?
