When was the last time you turned off your "device"?

I wake up and take the device, I go to sleep holding the device, I use it while I work and eat. This is a problem.

I turned off the device for an hour, I felt that my brain was recovering. No distractions, and no notifications, though I had disabled most of the notifications.

Me and my wife were practicing no-device weekends, it was awesome, and we probably need to return to that practice again.
