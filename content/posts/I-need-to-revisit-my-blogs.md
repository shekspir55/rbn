I try to write every day, blog posts are learnings. I write my observation from the day, from another day, or generally.

But if it's a learning do I use them? Do I revisit them in my mind? What actions do I perform going forward?

I have one suggestion, once or twice a week I will reread couple of my older blog posts and write my thoughts on them, we call it "reflections" in altMBA, though reflections you write on other people's comments there.

Hopefully, that will accelerate my growth.
