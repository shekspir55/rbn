I'm looking for a new job as an Fractional CTO / Engineering Manager or Full Stack Developer. I'm excited to find a place where I can use my skills and experience to make a real difference.

What I'm Good At:

* 12 years of coding experience, with 6 years working from home
* Leading teams of up to 15 people
* Expert in JavaScript, but I know many other coding languages too
* Building complex computer systems
* Helping other developers grow and learn
* Solving tough problems in creative ways

I'm not just looking for any job. I want to work somewhere that values new ideas, lets people take charge, and always wants to learn more. I'm great at coming up with new solutions, leading with understanding, and jumping in to help with hard tasks.

I'd love to work for:

* Remote companies that want to make the world better
* Places that let people work from home
* Teams that like open source and community work
* Jobs that mix coding with big-picture thinking

If you know of any jobs that might fit, or if you want to talk about how I could help your team, please let me know. I'm ready to start something new and work on projects that matter.

Let's build great things together!
