Some days are very productive. We love those.

Some are unproductive. We hate those.

And most of the days are somewhere in the middle. I think I don't appreciate them enough. Of course, this could have been the most productive day in your life, but it doesn't work like that.

You can't have a constant productive days everyday.

I need to remind myself to praise days in the middle, it could have been much worse.

# Remember that the progress needs consistency.
