My phone broke down and I still don't have a phone, I was at DIGITECH and WCIT. WCIT was meh, but Digitech was something from another world.

I had a call today, with amazing people, people I should meet again!

I want to say that I have progressed greatly. For the last couple of weeks, I have been doing it, shipping, and showing up.
