Breakdown of a task

1. understanding the task, including research
2. implementing a task
3. finalizing the task

Do these describe all tasks? Yes and No. Too general.

If the task is done the first time, there are a million unknowns and underwater rocks even if it initially seemed trivial. 

Let's say the task is done X amount of time already, are we better at estimating? Yes and No. If there are external parts to the system, like engaging with other people, systems, and processes outside our scope. We need to investigate external dependencies first, otherwise, we will find ourselves in a very difficult position every time.

There is a rule of thumb for estimating software engineer time by multiplying the time by x1.3 times, this doesn't include issues with external systems which are always happening. Documentation never is there.

# Break down the task as much as possible, estimate each section, be patient, and learn from previous breakdowns and mistakes. It will help you next time, for sure.
