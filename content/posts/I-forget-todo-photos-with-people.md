In my journey to promote my consultancy and promoting my foundation I meet with a ton of people. People who want to help me, people who are ready to share their experience, and I take notes, I listen carefully.

I know that the path that I took, is an influencer path because if I want to make an impact I need to escape my comfort zone and become an influencer.

Mathew Zein is tech writer, and he shares photos from places and people he meets, and it's awesome to look at, I wish I had more courage to do so.

Well, that's another skill I need to develop, along with commenting on people's posts.
