Everyone should rest: my coworkers, my family, my friends, everyone.

But not me, I can go forever, I'm a nonstop motor.

## What? That can't be right!

Concerning ourselves, it's tough to convince one to get some rest. With me, it's the same.

# We all need time to recharge, as frequently as possible. I will try to overcome myself to get rest as soon and frequently as possible. 

## I'm a fire that burns bright but runs out of fuel frequently.
