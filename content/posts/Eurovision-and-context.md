Yesterday, I watched Eurovision. It's clear that everyone wants their country to win, while some countries hope others don't win.

Neighbors tend to give their top votes to their neighbors. Similarly, political allies vote for each other, and countries with shared languages or cultural backgrounds also support one another.

Despite the tough competition, I believe Eurovision is more about context than the quality of the songs.

Many countries choose to perform songs that resonate more with their own nation and culture. 

But in global setting there are 3 main reasons to win
1. Geopolitics and propoganda
2. Similarities in culture
3. Context - how good people understand the persons struggles

Unfortunately, context, which is the most representative of equality, is in the last place.

UPD: Context + being an outliner in the category you are e.g. are you freeky enough? are you old but a different kind of old? Do you look different and act in dramatically different way.
