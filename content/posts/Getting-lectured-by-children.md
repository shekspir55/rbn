I was invited to an event, where I needed to give a talk to children from MEM Lori, I thought I was there to perform, but kids outperformed me.

I was talking to them, explaining a situation which is hard to solve, and they knew the solution. They have so much more context. 

And I got lectured by children, I wrote down ideas and I will try them.
