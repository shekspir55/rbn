This is my third community. I'm starting to understand how it works.

People with simir interests or challanges tend to have similar insights and views on issues. They share their insights and experiances, and soon they feel coneection and emphathy.

## Is this my legace? Building communities?
I have no idea what I'm doing, thought I feel that a lot of people who are into this buisness need me or expertice.

## Not CTOs though :D
CTOs need me only to organize the events :D and add them to this channels. But nothing more ATM. My technical expertise is not enough for them probably?

I helped 2 technical founders with my cervices. 1 with their CI/CD and the other with engineering processes.

 Not sure I can help other CTOs or if they need my services at all.
