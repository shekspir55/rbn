I went to sleep thinking about [Exposing Yourself Is Hard ðŸª¨](/posts/exposing-yourself-is-hard) the last blog.

How am I expected to draw well, if I watched only videos? How can I validate myself and become better? I cannot. Not without external help, comments, reviews, etc...

So please expect me to fail, and fail hard. As if I'm willing to try I will certainly fail. And please give me feedback, I will try to accept it, as is without biases. Don't tell me "good work" when it's not, criticize me and tell me what you think, for that I will tell you, thank you!

We need lots of practice and have our handwriting, our style, the authentic one, that people can recognize. Only after that, we can outsource as we have seen the quality we want to meet.
