I tend not to write blogs on some days, mostly when I'm too tired or busy with guests.

Is this a good enough reason? I will not answer this question, you all know the answer.

I create a strategy and try to stick to it. Finding a plan is hard enough.

What can we do?

Iterate, validate, and adapt, until it works, and it will work.

# Do bad, do better, iterate.
