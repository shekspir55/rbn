I don't have a client yet. I hope to have one by tomorrow, or next week.

Talking to people is awesome, they tell me their problems, and if I can help, I will help. If not, I will be honest and tell them that.

I had a dopamine rush today talking to a potential client. Calling people is a dopamine roller coaster, and a journey must start somewhere. 

## This feels like a great start.

# Wish me luck!
