Today I and my wife went to a friend. She has a beautiful home which she made into an ethnic restaurant.

She has a lot of pain and energy, she doesn't leave the house much and channels all the positive and negative energy to create and evolve the place.

You should have seen the development of the place in a year, the amount of work done is incredible. 

I think it's because of the energy channeling in the right direction, not grief or energy un, but developing business in this case.
