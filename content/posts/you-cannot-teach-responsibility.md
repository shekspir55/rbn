It can be only given and taken. We need to trust people, trust them to make mistakes but also believe that person can succeed.

Nearly every time I delegate responsibility I am proud of the result. Same as it was today.

We should do it more with our kids, partners, and coworkers as often as possible, they will learn and will do better each time and maybe then they will help us free some time.
