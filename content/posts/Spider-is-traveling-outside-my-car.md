2 months ago I found it, weaving webs outside my window. In my opinion, it's not the best place to do so.

Generally, I don't travel too much, on average a couple of times a week in the city. Since the spider appeared I had driven around 400 km from town to city.

Imagine being a spider traveling at a speed of 90 km/h outside the car,🕷️🏎️  and sometimes finding yourself in different cities, tasting a diversity of bugs.🐛

So why my car? Why not a tree?
The spider seems very successful, it has grown 4 times in these 2 months.

My wife thinks that the car is yellow, and it attracts bugs thus making the spider very successful and this theory makes sense.

# If it's true at the end of the day, again, it's all about the environment.
