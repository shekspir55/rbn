My phone broke down so I couldn't post shorts on YouTube, today I spent time running Android on my laptop. Well, Weydroid ran with a plain Android but I couldn't run Google services, for some reason at the last step the request failed to register an account. I ordered a new screen from Ifixit, so we'll see how it goes.

It's funny how are starting to use certain "computers" to do 1 job, it's like people want for things to have meanings. 

Yesterday's podcast was so incredible, that I was hyped. I know that I'm in the zone when I talk about certain topics.
