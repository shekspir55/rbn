A year back I discovered I didn't know how to rest. I knew how to push it forward. 

I discovered that when I was asked how do I rest? And I was unsure.

I discovered that there are different ways of rest for me
- Gathering with friends
- Deligating my decision-making to others and avoiding stressful situations
- Traveling and spending time with my family
- Gardening

Do you know how to rest? Are you doing it regularly enough? 

# Start by finding your ways to rest. Write down on paper what is your ideal vacation, and try to think of ways ho to achieve it.
