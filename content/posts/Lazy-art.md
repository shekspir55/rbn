Art is something you do more not less, but what if you generate NFTS, is it lazy art? You do more but with code. Are you making more art? If you create 10 interchangeable assets you can now generate 1024 NFTs for some reason.

So how do we define ART? I think when I don't run from it, and try to make more of it, it's art, and I feel that I want to surround me with art concepts.
