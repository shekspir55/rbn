Winning is the target, but the journey is never about winning. You cannot be sure the path is correct. Even with guidance, there is a chance it's not your path, it's not the right path.

Then why bother?

For learnings. The more I learn to find patterns, the better I will match them. And if I do it again, and again, I will become better, which will help me increase my chance of winning. That's it.

It's like in quantum computing or the theory of games, the only purpose is not to guarantee but to increase your chances dramatically.
