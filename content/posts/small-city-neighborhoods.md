Neighborhoods in big cities are crowded. Most of the time you know only your nearest neighbors. There are no deep connections in most cases.

But it doesn't seem to be a very close relationship.

In smaller cities and villages everything is different. You know your neighbors, you live with their problems. If you don't help them today they will not help you tomorrow.

# This is how a healthy society should work when you can't choose people who are your neighbors, and you still care about them.
