Asking the right question is a skill. Being silent is a skill.

My job is to listen, carefully. Most of the time people know the solutions to their problems.

I enjoy talking to people and discovering issues, for every person it's different but there is one trait that I feel is missing for many of us.

We are bad at communicating information, we are bad at communicating emotions and we are bad at asking for help.

# Those are also skills that we can improve over time. This includes me as well.
