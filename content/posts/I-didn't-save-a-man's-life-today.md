But I've tried. 

I was doing CPR for 10 minutes until the ambulance arrived, but it was too late. 

It was probably too late when I started doing CPR. I remembered my training at VOMA, and though I didn't follow all the instructions, I did what I could.

I need to train more, and maybe next time I will have more luck.
