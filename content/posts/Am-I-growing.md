Since I've started my journey of entrepreneurship, I've been doing podcasts, creating communities, and organizing meetups. 


Did I grow?

I think I did:
- Every podcast is a mentorship for me.
- Every person I talk to who can give me feedback wants my success.

It's not enough

### What's the issue?

I feel like I don't ask people, what do they want me to do enough? What do I do wrong? I'm sure I do a lot of things wrong and I'm told once a while but it's not enough.
I know that I should do better, to ask what I'm doing wrong and not be afraid to be pointed at my weak spots.

## That's how we get better.
