I write a blog because
I care
I want you to care
I want to put myself in the world
I want you to read this
I want to have a record history

Sometimes I don't post for a day and it is a big problem.  I think I can skip a day, and that is what makes you quit a habit you want to develop.


This is like allowing you to smoke whenever you want, and then you find yourself always wanting. 

# You shouldn't promise what you will not follow up with, but also be less harsh on yourself.
