I have to do a lot of things during the day. I need to spend time with my family. I need to feed the dog.

But what I need more is a plan for everything. I feel like my brain is a RAM, and it can handle so much. Writing it down is the key.

I have done it countless times, sometimes it didn't work, and it's ok. Consistency is the key.

I've done it today, and I will do it tomorrow. 

I will write down my long term goal, one more time.
